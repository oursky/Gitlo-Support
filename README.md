### Q: What is Gitlo?

Gitlo is a two-way sync that connects your GitHub issues and Trello cards.

### Q: Why do I need it?

Many Agile / Scrum teams find that Kanban boards work extremely well for monitoring the progress when it comes to project development and bug fixes because of the visualization. Trello and Github are known for its Kanban boards and issue tracker respectively, thatâ€™s why we built Gitlo for you to focus on managing the project, rather than overspending your time managing one of the two. Some other benefits include:

- Better communication between Engineers and Project Managers
- Visualize Github issues in Trello for easier task management

### Q: What does this repository do?

This is the official Gitlo Support with GitHub Issue Tracker, if you have any Question / Enquiry / Request / Bug report, please feel free to open an issue here. We will support you like what other open-source community does ;)
